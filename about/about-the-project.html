        <h2>Interesting Findings</h2>
        <ul> 
        <li>We were surprised how well organized, and weirdly disorganized, the crime data is</li>
        <li>We were surprised by how easy the map setup was, looking at the code (At least, Reece was)</li>
        <li>Reece was surprised with how easy the form creation was for creating new crime information (setting up the text entry bars and passing the data to the server)</li>  
        <li>Kino was kinda dismayed by how long the main Vue file got by the end. It feels kinda object un-oriented</li>
        <li>Nominatim's API was weirdly easy to use</li>
        <li>The fact that frogtown is a place that exists and that I could live there</li>
        </ul>
